        <p>I am fascinated by the brain not merely as a biological command center, but as a dynamic repository of memory and knowledge. Over the past several years, this perspective has guided my exploration of knowledge graphs and structured representations of information. These interests ultimately led me to found Reteena, a research and development community focused on advancing understanding and solutions for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
