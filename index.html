            <p class="intro">
                For the past few years, I've been exploring Neo4j and knowledge graphs across different 
                domains—from autonomous vehicles to Alzheimer's diagnostics

            <p class="about">
                I previously co-founded Reteena, which I'm now involved with as a board member. I'm not 
                sure what I want to do next, but I'm not rushing it. I'd rather explore things with depth and 
                patience. I'm happiest when I'm around people I'm comfortable with.
