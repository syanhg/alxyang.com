        <p>Hey, I'm Alex. 18 years old</p>
        
        <p>For the past few years, I've been exploring Neo4j and knowledge graphs across different domains—from autonomous vehicles to Alzheimer's diagnostics</p>
        
        <p>I previously co-founded <a href="https://reteena.org" target="_blank">Reteena</a>. I'm not sure what I want to do next, but I'm not rushing it. I'd rather explore things with depth and patience. I'm happiest when I'm around people I'm comfortable with.</p>
